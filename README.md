Use this command to start your project.

Use this command to startapp.
(Use this command: python manage.py startapp YourAppName)

Make a urls.py file in YourAppName folder.

Create one folder in YourAppName to write templates code like html, css or js.

Create two files in newly created folder to write code.

Then, run your server.
